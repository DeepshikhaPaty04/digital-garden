## **Kismet**

- **Kismet** is an open-source, **wireless network detector**, **sniffer**, and **intrusion detection system** (IDS) that is primarily used to **monitor, detect, and analyze** wireless networks, especially in the **802.11 (Wi-Fi)** range. 
- It’s widely used for **Wi-Fi security auditing**, **network diagnostics**, and **penetration testing** in both **enterprise** and **personal networks**.

- Inside the `/etc/kismet/` directory, you'll find various **Kismet configuration files**, which control the behavior and setup of **Kismet**

### `/etc/kismet/kismet.conf`

- **Primary configuration file.**
- Controls global Kismet behavior.

### `mask_datasource_interface=wlan0`

#### ✅ Reason for enabling:

This setting **masks (hides) the real interface name** (like `wlan0`) in logs, file names, and the web UI.

#### ❓ Why this might be useful:

- For **privacy/security reasons** — especially if you're sharing logs publicly or in research.
- Avoids revealing personal hardware details in logs or reports.

> [!NOTE]
> > “When logging or showing data, don’t display the name `wlan0` — replace it with a generic name like `wifi0`.”

### `source=wlan0`

#### ✅ Reason for enabling:

This line **defines the wireless interface** that Kismet should use to capture packets.

#### ❓ Why this is needed:

- Kismet doesn't automatically choose an interface.
- You have to **explicitly tell it** which interface (like `wlan0`) to use.
- Without this line, Kismet wouldn't know what to listen on — and you’d likely get an error or no data.

> [!NOTE]
> > “Use the `wlan0` interface to sniff wireless traffic.”

## What Data Does Kismet Collect About Wi-Fi?

###  1. **SSID (Network Name)**

- The name of the wireless network.
- Can detect **hidden SSIDs** if devices are trying to connect.
    

###  2. **BSSID (Access Point MAC Address)**

- The **unique identifier** (MAC address) of each AP.
- Used to distinguish between multiple APs with the same SSID.
    

###  3. **Channel Information**

- The **channel or frequency** the network is operating on (e.g., Channel 1, 6, 11).
- Can show **channel hopping** or frequency shifting patterns.


### **4. Encryption & Authentication**

- Shows what kind of **security** the network uses:
    - Open
    - WEP
    - WPA/WPA2/WPA3 (PSK, Enterprise)


### 5. **Connected Devices (Clients)**

- Lists devices **connected to each AP**.
- Shows:
    - Client MAC addresses
    - Which BSSID they’re talking to
    - Whether they're active or probing for networks


### **6. Packet Details**

- Kismet captures and decodes:
    - Beacon frames
    - Probe requests/responses
    - Association/Disassociation frames
    - Deauth packets (used in attacks)
        
- Can be saved as `.pcap` for Wireshark analysis.
- It also shows the number of received packets and transferred packets.

Rx - received packets
Tx - Transfer packets
llc- link layer control

AP - access point (when someone is trying to connect)

## SSID vs. BSSID

|Term|Full Form|Meaning|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|**SSID**|Service Set Identifier|The **name of the Wi-Fi network**|`CoffeeShop_WiFi`, `MyHomeNetwork`|
|**BSSID**|Basic Service Set Identifier|The **MAC address of the Wi-Fi access point (AP)**|`00:14:22:01:23:45`|
