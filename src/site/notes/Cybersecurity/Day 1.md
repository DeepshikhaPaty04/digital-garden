## **Near Field Communication (NFC)**

NFC is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate over short distances (typically 4 cm or less). It operates at **13.56 MHz** and enables secure and quick transactions. NFC is widely used in:

- **Contactless payments** (Google Pay, Apple Pay, credit cards)
- **Access control** (keycards, hotel room access)
- **Data sharing** (between smartphones, tablets)
- **Public transportation** (metro cards, bus passes)
- **Smart posters and tags** (providing additional information via NFC-enabled devices)

## **Communication System**

A communication system consists of:

1. **Sender** - The entity that transmits the message.
  
2. **Receiver** - The entity that receives the message.
   
3. **Transmission Medium** - The channel through which the message travels (e.g., wired or wireless).
   
4. **Message** - The information being communicated.
   
5. **Protocols** - The set of rules that govern data exchange between sender and receiver.

## **Basics of Linux**

- **What is an OS?**
    
    - An Operating System (OS) is software that acts as an interface between hardware and users. It manages resources and provides services for applications.
    
    - **Types of Interfaces:**
        
        - **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** - User-friendly interface with icons and windows.
         
        - **Command Line Interface (CLI)** - Text-based interface for executing commands.
        

### **Types of Operating Systems**

1. **Single-user OS** - Designed for one user at a time (e.g., Windows, macOS).
 
2. **Multi-user OS** - Allows multiple users to access the system simultaneously (e.g., Linux, UNIX).
   
3. **Real-time OS** - Used in time-sensitive applications (e.g., medical systems, robotics).
   
4. **Embedded OS** - Designed for embedded systems like IoT devices.

## **Servers and Services**

- A **server** is any device providing services to other devices or users on a network.

- **Common server types:**
    
    - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** - Assigns dynamic IP addresses to devices.
    
    - **WWW (Web Server)** - Hosts websites and serves web content.
    
    - **DNS (Domain Name System)** - Translates domain names into IP addresses.

## **Network and Internet Basics**

### **Network Types**

1. **LAN (Local Area Network)** - A network within a small area like a home or office.
  
2. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** - Covers a larger area, such as a city.
   
3. **WAN (Wide Area Network)** - Covers a broad geographical area, like the internet.
   

### **Network Topologies**

1. **Bus** - A single central cable connects all nodes.
  
2. **Star** - All nodes are connected to a central hub.
   
3. **Ring** - Each node is connected to two others in a circular format.
   
4. **Mesh** - Every node connects to every other node.
   
5. **Hybrid** - A combination of two or more topologies.

## **IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi Standard)**

IEEE 802.11 is the set of wireless networking standards that define how Wi-Fi networks operate. These standards are developed by the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)**. Key aspects include:

- **802.11a** - Operates at 5 GHz with speeds up to 54 Mbps.

- **802.11b** - Operates at 2.4 GHz with speeds up to 11 Mbps.
   
- **802.11g** - Operates at 2.4 GHz with speeds up to 54 Mbps.
   
- **802.11n** - Uses both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, offering higher speeds and better range.
   
- **802.11ac** - Works on the 5 GHz band, supports multi-user MIMO, and provides gigabit speeds.
   
- **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)** - Improves network efficiency, supports higher data rates, and reduces congestion.

## **Cyber Threats**

- **Malware** (Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Ransomware)

- **Phishing** (Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive data)
   
- **DDoS Attacks** (Distributed Denial of Service)
   
- **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attacks**
   
- **Zero-day Exploits** (Attacks on unpatched vulnerabilities)

## **History and Distribution of Linux**

- **History:** Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, Linux is an open-source OS based on UNIX.

- **Popular Distributions:**
    
    - Ubuntu  
    - Debian
    - Fedora
    - Arch Linux
    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

## **Transmission Media**

1. **Wired** (Ethernet, Fiber Optics, Coaxial Cable)  
2. **Wireless** (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Radio Waves, Infrared)

## **How the Internet Works**

The internet operates using a system of interconnected networks. It relies on:

- **ISPs (Internet Service Providers)** for connectivity.
 
- **Protocols (TCP/IP)** for data transmission.
  
- **DNS** for domain name resolution.


### **IP Address Types**

1. **Public IP** - Provided by ISPs, unique on the internet.
  
2. **Private IP** - Used within a private network.
   
3. **Static IP** - Fixed and does not change.
   
4. **Dynamic IP** - Changes periodically, assigned by DHCP.

## **Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 Companies in Networking**

- **Tier 1** - Backbone providers with global reach (e.g., AT&T, Verizon, NTT). They have direct access to all internet routes and do not pay for transit.
  
- **Tier 2** - Regional ISPs that connect to Tier 1 providers for internet access. They pay Tier 1 providers for connectivity but provide services to Tier 3 companies.
   
- **Tier 3** - Local ISPs that connect end-users (homes, businesses) and rely on Tier 2 providers for internet access.

## **How Torrent Works?**

- Uses **peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing** to distribute files.
   
- Instead of downloading from a single source, users download parts of the file from multiple sources.
   
- **Seeders** - Users who share the complete file.  
- **Leechers** - Users downloading the file.
- **Trackers** - Servers that coordinate peer connections.
