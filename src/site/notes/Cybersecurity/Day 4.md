## **CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**

- **Confidentiality:** Ensures that data is only accessible to authorized users.
- **Integrity:** Ensures data is accurate and unaltered by unauthorized entities.
- **Availability:** Ensures data is accessible when needed by authorized users.

---

## **Key Legal Frameworks in Information Security**

- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):**
    - A U.S. law that protects sensitive patient health information.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**
    - A European Union regulation that enhances the protection of personal data.
    - Penalties for non-compliance can exceed **4% of global turnover**.

---

## **Importance of Information Security**

- Protects against unauthorized access, misuse, modification, and destruction of data.
- Ensures the protection of personal, financial, and proprietary information.


---

## **Data Selling on the Dark Web**

- Stolen data, including personal and financial details, is often sold on dark web marketplaces.

---

## **Information Security vs Cybersecurity**

- **Cybersecurity:** Focuses on protecting digital systems and networks from cyberattacks.
- **Information Security:** Encompasses all aspects of securing data, whether digital or physical.


---

## **Hackers vs Crackers**

- **Hackers:** Skilled individuals with good intentions (e.g., ethical hacking).
- **Crackers:** Individuals who hack with malicious intent (e.g., breaking into systems for personal gain).

---

## **Types of Hackers**

- **White Hat Hackers:** Ethical hackers working to improve security.
- **Black Hat Hackers:** Malicious hackers aiming to exploit systems for personal gain.
- **Gray Hat Hackers:** Operate between white and black hats, sometimes engaging in hacking without malicious intent but without authorization.

---

## **Information Security Threat Categories**

- **Information Gathering:** Unauthorized collection of sensitive information.
- **Sniffing and Eavesdropping:** Intercepting network traffic to steal data.
- **Password-based Attacks:** Trying to gain unauthorized access through passwords.
- **DoS (Denial of Service):** Overloading systems to disrupt services.
- **Other Categories:** Could include physical security threats, malware, etc.

---

## **Hacking Classes**

- **Suicide Hackers:** Individuals who risk their lives for hacking (often for political or ideological reasons).
- **Script Kiddies:** Inexperienced hackers using pre-written scripts for attacks.
- **Cyber Terrorists:** Hackers using attacks to cause widespread fear or damage.
- **State-Sponsored Hackers:** Hackers hired or supported by governments for espionage or attacks.
- **Hacktivists:** Hackers using their skills for political activism or social change.


---

## **Impact of Hacking**

- **Reputational Impact:** Loss of trust and damage to the organization's image.
- **Operational Impact:** Disruptions to business operations or system functionality.
- **Financial Impact:** Direct monetary loss due to fraud, fines, or loss of business.
- **Legal Impact:** Legal consequences, including lawsuits and regulatory penalties.


---

## **Basic Security Terminologies**

- **Vulnerability:** A weakness that could be exploited by a threat.
- **Exploit:** A tool or method used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
- **Attack:** Any action that compromises security.
- **Payload:** Malicious code delivered by an attack.
- **Asset:** Anything of value to an organization (data, infrastructure, intellectual property).
- **Hack Value:** The potential value gained from compromising a system or stealing data.
- **Risk:** The likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
- **Threat:** A potential danger to information or systems.
- **Bot/Botnet:** Automated tools used to perform malicious activities; botnets are networks of compromised systems.
- **Trojan:** Malicious software disguised as legitimate programs.
- **Daisy Chaining:** Connecting multiple malicious actions or vulnerabilities together to execute a large-scale attack.
- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Information that can be used to identify an individual.

## **Achieving CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**

- Implement access controls, encryption, and redundancy to ensure **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**.

---

## **Elements of Information Security**

1. **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
2. **Integrity:** Ensure data is accurate and remains unmodified unless authorized.
3. **Availability:** Make sure data and systems are accessible when needed by legitimate users.
4. **Authenticity:** Verify the identity of users and systems.
5. **Non-repudiation:** Ensure that actions (such as sending or receiving data) cannot be denied by the parties involved.

---

## **Domain Name System (DNS)**

- **DNS:** The system that translates domain names (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) into IP addresses.
- **DNS Records:**
    1. **Forward Lookup:** Translates domain names into IP addresses.
    2. **Reverse Lookup:** Translates IP addresses into domain names.
    3. **MX Records:** Used for email routing.
    4. **CNAME Record:** Used to map one domain to another.
    5. **AAAA Record:** Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.

---

## **Hashing Algorithms**

- **Hashing:** A one-way process used to generate a fixed-size output (hash) from variable input data, often used for password storage and data integrity verification.


---

## **Introduction to AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)**

- **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a user or system.
- **Authorization:** Determining what actions or resources the authenticated entity is allowed to access.
- **Accounting:** Tracking user activity and resource usage for auditing and reporting purposes.


---

## **Social Engineering**

- **Phishing:** Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information, typically through email (e.g., a fake Google Drive link).
- **Quishing:** Phishing attacks conducted via QR codes, which can lead to malicious websites or actions when scanned by unsuspecting users.
