3) ![attachments/Pasted image 20250314110724.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314110724.png)
4) ![attachments/Pasted image 20250314110739.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314110739.png)
5) after login-> view profile
![attachments/Pasted image 20250314111018.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314111018.png)

- after view profile you can see this page:
![attachments/Pasted image 20250314111108.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314111108.png)

6) intercept on -> refresh this view profile page after login → go to burp and send to repeater

7) edit the employee id form 101 to 102→ then click on SEND
![attachments/Pasted image 20250314111150.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314111150.png)

8) do right click → show response in browser → open the link the burp's browser's new TAB.
![attachments/Pasted image 20250314111205.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314111205.png)

9) we can see we logged in as larry , now after edting the employee id we logged in as MODE STOOGE.
![attachments/Pasted image 20250314111220.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314111220.png)

### **Conclusion**
- Parameter manipulation happens when a user changes a value in a request to access something they shouldn’t.
- Example: I logged in as Larry and saw my profile with employee_id=10 1 . I changed it to employee_id=102 in the request and accessed Moe's account without permission. This shows the system doesn’t check if I have the right to view it.

2. go insecure config→ forced browsing → intercept on → then refresh the page
![attachments/Pasted image 20250314112428.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314112428.png)

![attachments/Pasted image 20250314112529.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314112529.png)

5. then go to Payloads section → then select the add from list → filesname short → directories short ,short → directories short
![attachments/Pasted image 20250314112555.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314112555.png)

![attachments/Pasted image 20250314112611.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314112611.png)

- similarly click on directories - short

8. 302 → stands for redirection → then send to repeater and go to repeater section
![attachments/Pasted image 20250314112710.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314112710.png)

9. send → follow redirection
![attachments/Pasted image 20250314112725.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314112725.png)

![attachments/Pasted image 20250314112750.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/25%20Feb%20(Tuesday)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250314112750.png)

### **Conclusion**
- The application allows an unauthenticated user to configure administrative privileges and passwords for other users.
- If an unauthenticated user can access URLs that should require authentication or hold sensitive information this is a security vulnerability.
