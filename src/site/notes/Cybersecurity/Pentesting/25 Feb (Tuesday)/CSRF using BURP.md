### **Conclusion**

- Browsers limit sessionStorage to a single tab to ensure that data stored in one tab does not get accessed or shared by another tab. This prevents conflicts when multiple tabs of the same website are open, ensuring that temporary data, like form inputs or authentication tokens, remain isolated per session. Unlike localStorage, which is shared across all tabs, sessionStorage is designed for security and privacy, as it automatically clears when the tab is closed. This helps maintain a unique session experience without affecting other tabs of the same website.
