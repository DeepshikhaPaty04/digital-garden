# **Using Burp to Hack Cookies and Manipulate Sessions**
---
[Access the lab](https://portswigger.net/support/using-burp-to-hack-cookies-andmanipulate-sessions)

#### Using Burp to Brute Force a Login Page :
1. Set Up Burp Suite 
- Ensure Burp is configured with your browser.
- In Burp Proxy, turn "Intercept Off" and visit the login page.

2. Capture the Login Request
- Enable "Intercept On" in Burp Proxy.
- Enter random credentials and submit the login form.
- Burp captures the request.

3. Send Request to Intruder
- Right-click the captured request → "Send to Intruder".
- Go to the Intruder tab → "Positions".
- Select username and password as payload positions.
- Set Attack Type to "Cluster bomb".

4. Configure Payloads
- In the "Payloads" tab:▪ Set Payload Set 1 (username) → Enter possible usernames.
- Set Payload Set 2 (password) → Enter possible passwords.
- Click "Start Attack".

5. Analyze Results
- Sort results by Length and Status.
- Identify successful login attempts.

6. Verify Success
- Use the discovered credentials to log in manually.

#### Additional Considerations :
- Account Lockout: Some sites lock accounts after multiple failed attempts.
- Verbose Error Messages: Errors revealing if a username exists can help attackers.
- Burp Scanner: Automate scanning for authentication vulnerabilities.
