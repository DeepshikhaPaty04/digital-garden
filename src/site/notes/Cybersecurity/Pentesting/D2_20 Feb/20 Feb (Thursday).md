**MOST IMPORTANT - GO THROUGH IT IN YOUR FREE TIME**
[Owasp websecurity testing guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/)

## *Task 1 :*
- Authenticated zap scanning:

---

1. Open the `integrated server`

2. after opening the integrated firefox , hit the [server](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) in the burp suite's integrated browser(firefox).

3.  then right click on `POST` -> `include in context` -> `POST: userinfo/ new context` ->

4.  then select the `authentication` -> `form-based authentication` -> then `select the targert url` (rest details will come automatically)

5.  go to `users`-> `add`-> give the `username` ->check on `enabled` -> then username and password

6. go to `authentication` -> regex (from view source code page ,by clicking inspect)
- always stay in the `login page` while viewing the source code.

6. then, from `view source code` page copy this and paste in the regext part.

7. then enable the forced user mode

8.  right click on the `POST`: `username` -> `Attack` -> `Active Scan`

9. then after scanning, view all pages in the website so that zap can scan all the pages properly.
10.  then you can go the `Alert section` and then view the vulnerabilities. (the number of alerts and the type of alerts).

## *Task 2 :* 
- Authenticated scanning using burp suite:
- [Refer this site](https://medium.com/@secureica/authenticated-scan-using-owasp-zap-f0a71dafe41)


1.  `new scan` -> `scan configuration` -> `lightweight`
![attachments/Pasted image 20250309011941.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/D2_20%20Feb/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250309011941.png)

2.  then go to the `scan` details and paste the url.

3. then go to the `application login` -> click on `new` -> give the following details highlighted the password is test
![attachments/Pasted image 20250309012134.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/D2_20%20Feb/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250309012134.png)

4. you can see the vulnerability scanning in the `crawl and audit section.`and then click `view details` (after completion of total scanning)

5.  go to `issue activity` ,then you can see the rest all type of vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, sql injection, cross site forgery..

### Q) What are application security risks ?
- SLA : you need to close the vulnerability as soon as possible (the timeline) , the timeline to fix the issues :
  → critical : 7 days or immediately
  → high : 30 days
  → medium: 60 days
  → low : 90 days
- Threat agent : who is performing the attack
- attack vector : what he is using to perform the attack

### Q) What's My risk? (you have to give your client the risk report, hence imp)
