[Access the lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/llm-attacks/lab-exploiting-llm-apis-with-excessive-agency)

1. From the lab homepage, select **Live chat**.
2. Ask the LLM what APIs it has access to. Note that the LLM can execute raw SQL commands on the database via the Debug SQL API.

3. Ask the LLM what arguments the Debug SQL API takes. Note that the API accepts a string containing an entire SQL statement. This means that you can possibly use the Debug SQL API to enter any SQL command.

4. Ask the LLM to call the Debug SQL API with the argument `SELECT * FROM users`. Note that the table contains columns called `username` and `password`, and a user called `carlos`.

5. Ask the LLM to call the Debug SQL API with the argument `DELETE FROM users WHERE username='carlos'`. This causes the LLM to send a request to delete the user `carlos` and solves the lab.
