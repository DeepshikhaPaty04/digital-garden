## **Installing firefox**

1. Install firefox .
2. Open Chrome : [Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/).

- ***Concept*** : when we used the integrated browser of burp, we can use burp suite directly in the burp's browser to capture the traffic. But in foxyproxy standard , both the client and burp needs to be integrated with each other to capture the traffic.
3. Open in firefox : [demo.testfire website](https://demo.testfire.net/)
4. Then to integrate proxyfoxy and burp :
    `open the proxyfoxy` --> `options` --> `Proxies` --> add & save it:

   5. Open proxy select the option burp :

6. Go to firefox and type : http://burp
7. Download the CA certificate file.
