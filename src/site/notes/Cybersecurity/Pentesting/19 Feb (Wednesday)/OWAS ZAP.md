## **Generating report**

 Click **`Report`** --> **`generate report`** --> **`template`**

Here, we can generate reports using various templates:
1. theme : `traditional html with request and response`

2. theme : `risk and confidence html`

3. theme : `modern html report with themes and options`

### *Note :*
End to end walk through is required i.e IN and OUT-flow of the project. Being a grey hat hacker in the company, without knowing the walkthrough, we should not work.

### *Note :*

It looks like you're asking about **port 404 and 200** in the context of **OWASP ZAP scanning**. Let's break it down:

1. **Port 404**
    
    - **404 is not a port number**â€”it is an **HTTP status code** that means "Not Found."
    - If ZAP shows **404 errors**, it means the requested page does not exist.
2. **Port 200**
    
    - **200 is also an HTTP status code**, meaning "OK" (successful request).
    - If ZAP scans a page and gets a **200 status code**, it means the page is accessible.


---

### ðŸ›  **How to Handle 404 and 200 in OWASP ZAP**

- **If you see 404 errors during scanning:**
    
    - The target website might have removed or restricted access to certain pages.
    - Try **manual exploration** before scanning to ensure the pages exist.
    - Check if the target website uses **dynamic URLs** that require authentication.
- **If you get 200 status codes:**
    
    - It means ZAP successfully reached the page and will continue scanning.
    - You can review response headers for security weaknesses.

### Q) Why do you need authenticated scanning? $(imp)$
- the tool need credential to do auntentication
- it can spider/crawl in depth (the tool can go to in-depth while scanning)
- in can find out more and more vulnerabilities compared to unauthenticated scan
- black box - can't show the internal vulnerabilities but with credentials it can go in depth scanning.

black box - does not require credentials
gray box - requires credentials
