## ðŸ”’ **Clickjacking (Click Hijacking):**

- The attacker **tricks you into clicking on something** without realizing what you're actually clicking.
- For example, they might hide a **"Delete Account"** button under a harmless-looking button like **"Play Video"**.
- So **you perform the action unknowingly**, but it's still **you who clicked the button**.

## ðŸ”’ **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**

- In this case, the attacker **sends a fake request to a website on your behalf**â€”for example, to transfer money or change your email.
- You **donâ€™t click anything related to the attack**, but it works because **youâ€™re already logged in**, and the website thinks the request is coming from you.
- **No interaction is needed from your side**, it just uses your active session to perform the action.

### âœ… **Key Difference:**

- **Clickjacking** = You are tricked into **clicking**.
- **CSRF** = You donâ€™t click; the attacker forges the request **without you knowing**.
