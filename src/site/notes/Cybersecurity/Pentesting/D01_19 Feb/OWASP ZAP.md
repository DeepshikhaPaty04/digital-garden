# **Owasp-Zap**

### üîê **What is OWASP ZAP?**

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is an **open-source security tool** designed for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is maintained by the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** and is widely used by penetration testers and security professionals for **dynamic application security testing (DAST)**.

- Select - yes, I want to persist this session

## **Scanning website using Owasp-Zap**

1. Start ZAP and click the **Quick Start** tab in the workspace window.
2. Click the **Auto Scan** button.
3. In the **Attack URL** text box, enter the full URL of the web application.

4. Select either **Use traditional spider, Use ajax spider**, or both (more details below)

### *Note:*
### **1. Understanding "Use Traditional Spider" in OWASP ZAP**

#### **What is the Traditional Spider?**

The **Traditional Spider** is a web crawler in OWASP ZAP that systematically follows links from a given starting URL to discover all pages and resources of a web application.

#### **How Does It Work?**

- It starts with the **URL to attack**.
- It analyzes the **HTML content** of the page.
- It extracts **all links** (e.g., `<a href="...">`, `<form action="...">`, `<iframe src="...">`).
- It follows each discovered link recursively until all pages are mapped.

#### **Why is It Important?**

- It helps **identify all accessible pages** on a site.
- It **builds a site map**, which is useful for vulnerability scanning.
- It finds **hidden endpoints** that may contain security flaws.

#### **Example**

Imagine scanning `http://example.com` with Traditional Spider.
- **Page 1:** `http://example.com/home`
- **Page 2 (linked from home):** `http://example.com/about`    
- **Page 3 (linked from about):** `http://example.com/contact`

### **2. Use AJAX Spider**

- **Functionality:** Crawls web applications using JavaScript to simulate user interactions and uncover hidden endpoints.
    
- **Decision:** **Choose the right setting** based on the type of application:
    - **If Modern (Dynamic JavaScript-based sites):** ‚úÖ Use AJAX Spider with a browser (Chrome, Firefox).
    - **If Traditional (Static HTML/CSS pages):** ‚ùå You may skip it.
        
- **Why?**
    - Needed for modern SPAs (Single Page Applications) using React, Angular, or Vue.js.
    - Essential for discovering endpoints loaded dynamically via JavaScript.

5. Click **Attack**.

### *Final Scan:*

## **Generating report**

 Click **`Report`** --> **`generate report`** --> **`template`**
 
![attachments/Pasted image 20250308142036.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308142036.png)

Here, we can generate reports using various templates:
1. theme : `traditional html with request and response`
   ![attachments/Pasted image 20250308142404.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308142404.png)

2. theme : `risk and confidence html`
   ![attachments/Pasted image 20250308142504.png](/img/user/Cybersecurity/Pentesting/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308142504.png)

3. theme : `modern html report with themes and options`

### *Note :*
End to end walk through is required i.e IN and OUT-flow of the project. Being a grey hat hacker in the company, without knowing the walkthrough, we should not work.

### *Note :*

It looks like you're asking about **port 404 and 200** in the context of **OWASP ZAP scanning**. Let's break it down:

1. **Port 404**
    
    - **404 is not a port number**‚Äîit is an **HTTP status code** that means "Not Found."
    - If ZAP shows **404 errors**, it means the requested page does not exist.
2. **Port 200**
    
    - **200 is also an HTTP status code**, meaning "OK" (successful request).
    - If ZAP scans a page and gets a **200 status code**, it means the page is accessible.


---

### üõ† **How to Handle 404 and 200 in OWASP ZAP**

- **If you see 404 errors during scanning:**
    
    - The target website might have removed or restricted access to certain pages.
    - Try **manual exploration** before scanning to ensure the pages exist.
    - Check if the target website uses **dynamic URLs** that require authentication.
- **If you get 200 status codes:**
    
    - It means ZAP successfully reached the page and will continue scanning.
    - You can review response headers for security weaknesses.


---

### Q) Why do you need authenticated scanning? $(imp)$
- the tool need credential to do authentication
- it can spider/crawl in depth (the tool can go to in-depth while scanning)
- in can find out more and more vulnerabilities compared to unauthenticated scan
- black box - can't show the internal vulnerabilities but with credentials it can go in depth scanning.

## **Black Box, White Box, and Gray Box Testing**

black box - does not require credentials
gray box - requires credentials

## **Comparison Table**

|**Aspect**|**Black Box**|**White Box**|**Gray Box**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Tester Knowledge**|No internal knowledge|Full internal knowledge|Partial knowledge|
|**Used for**|Functionality, security|Code security, unit testing|API security, privilege escalation|
|**Perspective**|External attacker|Developer or security analyst|Insider or semi-privileged user|
|**Examples**|Penetration testing, automated security scanning|Static code analysis, secure code review|API security testing, session management testing|
|**Efficiency**|Can miss internal logic flaws|Time-consuming but thorough|Balanced approach|
