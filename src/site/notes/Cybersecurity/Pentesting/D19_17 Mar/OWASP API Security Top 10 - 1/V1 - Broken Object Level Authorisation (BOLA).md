### **What is BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization)?**

BOLA happens when an API lets users access data just by changing the object ID in the request — **without checking if they’re allowed to do so**.

For example:  
If a user changes `/user/1` to `/user/2` in the API link and gets someone else’s data — that’s BOLA!


### **Why is it a problem?**

If there’s no **security check**, anyone can access private data just by changing the ID in the request.  
This can lead to:

- Personal data leaks
- `Account takeovers`
- Huge damage to a company’s trust and finances


### **How to Prevent BOLA?**

1. Always **check if the user is allowed** to access the data.
2. Use **access tokens** to identify who is making the request.
3. Use **random or encrypted IDs** so they can’t be guessed.
