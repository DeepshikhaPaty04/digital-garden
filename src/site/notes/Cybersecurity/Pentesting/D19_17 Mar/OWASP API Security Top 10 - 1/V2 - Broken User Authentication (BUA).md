### **What is Broken User Authentication (BUA)?**

It happens when an app or API doesn’t **properly check login credentials** (like email & password).  
This allows attackers to log in as someone else or get access they shouldn’t have.


### **How does it happen?**

- The API only checks **email**, but **ignores the password**.
- Hackers can just guess or find someone’s email and **log in without a password**.
- This can lead to **data leaks, changes, or full account takeover**.


### **Why is it dangerous?**
esuh   
- Hackers can **pretend to be someone else**
- They can **steal sensitive information**
- They can **delete or modify user data**
- They can `take control of someone’s account`



### **How to Prevent BUA?**

1. Always check **both email and password**.
2. Use **strong tokens** (like JWT) for security.
3. Never store passwords in plain text.
4. Add features like:
    - **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
    - **Account lockout after too many tries**
    - **CAPTCHA to stop bots**
5. Never show or send passwords in the URL or request body.
