### **What is Excessive Data Exposure?**

It happens when an API gives **too much information** in its response — including **private or sensitive data** that should not be shared with the user.

### **How does it happen?**

- Developers send **all data from the database**, thinking the front-end will **hide what’s not needed**.

- But if someone checks the raw API response (like with tools such as Talend or Postman), they can see **everything** — including things like:
    - Phone numbers
    - Account numbers
    - Access tokens
    - Device info, etc.


### **Why is it risky?**

- **Hackers** can easily read the raw response and **steal private info**.
- Sensitive data can be used to:
    - Access other systems
    - Pretend to be someone else
    - Attack users or the company


### **How to fix / prevent this?**

1. Only send **needed data** from the backend — not everything.
2. **Never depend on the front-end** to hide private info.
3. Regularly **check API responses** to make sure no sensitive info is leaked.
4. Avoid generic methods like `to_string()` or `to_json()` that return **everything**.
5. Test APIs (automated + manual) to make sure only safe data is returned.
