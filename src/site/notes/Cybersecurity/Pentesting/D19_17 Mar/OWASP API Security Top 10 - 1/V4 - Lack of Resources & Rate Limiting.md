This happens when an API **doesn’t control**:
- How **many times** someone can use it
- Or **how large** the data (like file size or number of requests) can be

So, an attacker can:
- Send **tons of requests** very fast
- Or upload **huge files**

This can **slow down or crash** the system — called a `Denial of Service (DoS) attack`.


### **Why is it risky?**

- The server gets **overloaded**
- It may **stop working** for real users
- Wastes **money**, resources, and **hurts brand image**


### **How to prevent this?**

1. ✅ **Add Captcha** to stop bots/scripts
2. ✅ **Limit request rates** (e.g., 1 OTP per 2 minutes)
3. ✅ **Set size limits** for data uploads (like max file size, string length)
4. ✅ **Alert** when limits are crossed
