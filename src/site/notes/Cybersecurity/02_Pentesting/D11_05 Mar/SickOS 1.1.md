- netdiscover, arpscan - recon tool
- netwrk scan --> available ip addresses gives

## Sick OS :
- It is a vulnerable machine which generally comes in `.ova` format used for practicing penetration testing

---
- After setting up the sick os
  - Initial challenge:
    - No ip address to map the attack surface (can be considered as a black box testing)
- Use arpscan or netdiscover to find out the ip address

### netdiscover:
- it is a arp tool used to discover any active address over the network

- from the available options we have used -r to specify the range and perform the scan

- `netdiscover -r 192.168.102.1/24`

- from both netdiscover and ifconfig we discovered that the ip address of sickos is `192.168.102.131`

- after discovering the ip address we proceed with nmap scan
  - `nmap -Pn -T5 -F -n -A IPADDR`

- From this scan, we detected there are 2 ports open
- As of now, we have no foothold on ssh
- We continue with port 3128 which contains http-proxy and is currently running on squid-proxy 3.1.19

- We set up the proxy on firefox
