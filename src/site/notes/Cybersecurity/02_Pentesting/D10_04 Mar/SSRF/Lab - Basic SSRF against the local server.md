This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user `carlos`.

[ACCESS THE LAB](https://portswigger.net/academy/labs/launch/c12feb39a2450b08c055e9e00a51dc9457d91c3b07b1c435d560f7a0a1cd959a?referrer=%2fweb-security%2fssrf%2flab-basic-ssrf-against-localhost)

---
### Goal:
Access the internal admin panel by editing the stockApi parameter and manually delete a
user via the admin UI.

---

 ###  STEPS :

1. Browse to `/admin` and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.
2. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
3. Change the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://localhost/admin`. This should display the administration interface.
4. Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:
    
    `http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos`
5. Submit this URL in the `stockApi` parameter, to deliver the SSRF attack.

### Summary :

This lab teaches that **SSRF vulnerabilities** can be used to:

- Bypass frontend restrictions
- Access **localhost-only services**
- Perform **sensitive actions** on internal systems
