This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal `192.168.0.X` range for an admin interface on port `8080`, then use it to delete the user `carlos`.

### **Goal**

The **main goal** of this lab is to:

- **Exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** vulnerability.
- **Scan and identify internal IP addresses** to find where an internal admin service is running.
- **Access that internal admin interface** through the vulnerable parameter.
- **Trigger a delete request** to remove the user `carlos`.


---
### **What's Happening**

This app has a **stock check feature** that takes a user-supplied URL (`stockApi`), and makes a **server-side request** to fetch stock info.

Since the server **trusts internal IP addresses**, but **you can't access them directly** from your browser, SSRF lets you **force the server to make those internal calls for you**.

---

### **STEPS :**

1. Visit a product, click **Check stock**, intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Intruder.
2. Change the `stockApi` parameter to `http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin` then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number `1`) and click **Add §**.
3. In the **Payloads** side panel, change the payload type to **Numbers**, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the **From** and **To** and **Step** boxes respectively.
4. Click  **Start attack**.
5. Click on the **Status** column to sort it by status code ascending. You should see a single entry with a status of `200`, showing an admin interface.
6. Click on this request, send it to Burp Repeater, and change the path in the `stockApi` to: `/admin/delete?username=carlos`

---

### **Summary**

This lab teaches you how SSRF vulnerabilities can be used not just to **access internal services**, but also to **scan internal networks** (like `192.168.x.x`) to **discover sensitive systems** running on private IPs, and then **interact with them**.

This simulates a common real-world scenario where an attacker maps and attacks **internal infrastructure via SSRF**.
