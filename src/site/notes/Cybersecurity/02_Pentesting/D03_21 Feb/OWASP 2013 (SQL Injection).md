- [Refer this github repo](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)
- interpreter is accepting special characters allowing it to sit dynamically in the query.
- id - ‘ ’ (single quote)
- String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'";
- id=5 -> String query = “SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID="" + request.getParameter('5') + “”;
- id=' -> String query = “SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID="" + request.getParameter(' ‘ ’) + “"”;
- check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‘ ‘ ’ at line 1.
- our special char balances the first char , but the second char gets imblanced , making it odd together , there by getting the error.
- ‘ '# ’-> comments out
