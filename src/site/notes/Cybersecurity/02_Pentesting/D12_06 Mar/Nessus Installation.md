## IVM Process

![[attachments/IVM Process.pdf]]

> [!NOTE]
> ### Key Concepts:
> 
> - **Infrastructure** = Servers, databases, firewalls, routers, etc.
> - **Vulnerability** = Weaknesses that hackers could exploit.
> - **Management** = Steps to find and fix those weaknesses.


> [!question]
> Why is an authenticated scanning required?
> 1. Better Results : Nessus gives more accurate results with login credentials.
> 2. Deep scanning : It can check inside the system, access important files, and find hidden vulnerabilities.
> 3. More vulnerabilities found : Without login, Nessus can only check open ports and services, missing deeper security risks.

### Reporting:

- Nessus provides results in PDF/CSV/HTML formats.
    
- Vulnerabilities are categorized as: **Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Info**.
    

---

###  Manual Analysis:

- After automated scanning, we do **manual checks** to confirm:
    - **True Positives** (vulnerabilities that really exist)
    - **False Positives** (flagged by tool but not actually there)
        
- Tools like **Burp Suite** and **Nmap** help verify results.
    

---

###  Remediation Process:

- Final report is shared with the respective teams.
- Teams are advised on **how to fix** the issues (patching, updates).
- **Patch timelines**:
    
    - Critical: 15 days
    - High: 30 days
    - Medium: 60 days
    - Low: 90 days
        
- If a fix isnâ€™t possible in time, the **asset owner must accept the risk** in writing.
    

---

###  Regular Scanning:

- **Monthly scans** are recommended to keep systems secure and up to date.
    

---

### Follow up:

â€¢Â Â Â  **Set Reminders**: Ensure follow-ups before the deadline to track remediation progress.

â€¢Â Â Â  **Rescanning**: Once patches are applied, rescan the servers to verify fixes. Repeat until all issues are resolved.

â€¢Â Â Â  **Risk Acceptance**: 
- If the Asset Owner cannot fix an issue on time, they must accept the risk.
- They must share a Risk Number with a reason and the expected fix timeline.

â€¢Â  Regular Nessus Scan: The scan is scheduled once a month to ensure continuous security.

### False positive analysis

1. `True Positive` :  means Nessus has flagged a vulnerability & upon manual analysis, we also got a confirmation that actually vulnerability is there.
2. `False Positive`:
  - means Nessus has flagged a vulnerability & upon manual analysis, we got a confirmation that actually vulnerability is not there
  - Nessus might have flagged the vulnerability based on the software version and the administrator might have forgotten to update the version info
  - Another scenario of False Positive can be using a patched software, but Nessus will still flag it vulnerable because software version info is still the old one.
3. `True Negative`: Nessus has not flagged a vulnerability & upon manual analysis, we also got a confirmation that actually vulnerability is not present
4. `False Negative` means Nessus has not flagged a vulnerability & upon manual analysis, we got a confirmation that actually vulnerability is present. 

> [!NOTE]
> For each flagged vulnerability raised by Nessus, there is one Plugin ID
> - Nessus client connects every day to Nessus central repository server to check for any plugin update & if it finds any new Plugin ID, it downloads to client machine
> - Nessus Scanner uses Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL)
> - With NASL specific attacks can be automated, based on known vulnerabilities & file extension is .nasl

ðŸ’¡ Through this learning, I understood not just how to use Nessus, but also the **importance of approvals, scanning strategy, report analysis, and continuous patch management** in keeping an organization safe.
