### **What is Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting?**

This happens when an API **doesnâ€™t control**:
- How **many times** someone can use it
- Or **how large** the data (like file size or number of requests) can be

So, an attacker can:
- Send **tons of requests** very fast
- Or upload **huge files**

This can **slow down or crash** the system â€” called a `Denial of Service (DoS) attack`.

> [!NOTE]
> In this context, it refers to the **server or application running out of system resources** (like CPU, memory, bandwidth, etc.) because the app is **not controlling how many requests** a user can make.

### Example 1:
> [!example]
> ### **Lack of Resources: Overloading a Website**
> 
> - **Example:**  
>     You notice that a website doesnâ€™t have enough servers or resources to handle heavy traffic. So, you send many requests to the site all at once, causing it to **slow down or crash**.
>     
> - **How it Works:**  
>     The website canâ€™t handle all the requests because it's not designed to manage too many users or actions at the same time.
>     
> - **Goal:**  
>     **Make the site unresponsive** or **crash it**, preventing real users from accessing the site.

## Example 2:
> [!example]
> ### **Lack of Resources: Sending Big Files to Crash the Server**
> 
> - **Example:**  
>     Thereâ€™s a file upload feature on a website. The server has limited storage, and you upload **huge files** repeatedly, filling up its space and making it slow or unresponsive.
>     
> - **How it Works:**  
>     The website canâ€™t store the large files because its storage capacity is exhausted, so it starts **slowing down or crashing**.
>     
> - **Goal:**  
>     **Overload the server** by consuming all its storage, making it impossible for others to upload files.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Why is it risky?**

- The server gets **overloaded**
- It may **stop working** for real users
- Wastes **money**, resources, and **hurts brand image**


### **âœ… How to prevent this?**

1. **Add Captcha** to stop bots/scripts
2.  **Limit request rates** (e.g., 1 OTP per 2 minutes)
3.  **Set size limits** for data uploads (like max file size, string length)
4.  **Alert** when limits are crossed
