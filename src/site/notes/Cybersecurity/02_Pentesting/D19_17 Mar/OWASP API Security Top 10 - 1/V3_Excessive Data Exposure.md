### **What is Excessive Data Exposure?**

It happens when an API gives **too much information** in its response â€” including **private or sensitive data** that should not be shared with the user.

### **How does it happen?**

- Developers send **all data from the database**, thinking the front-end will **hide whatâ€™s not needed**.

- But if someone checks the raw API response (like with tools such as Talend or Postman), they can see **everything** â€” including things like:
    - Phone numbers
    - Account numbers
    - Access tokens
    - Device info, etc.

> [!example]
> 
> - A mobile shopping app displays a user's order summary.
> - But when analyzing the API response using a tool like Postman or a browser developer tool, the **entire user object is returned**, including sensitive data like:
>     - Full address
>     - Email ID
>     - Credit card number (masked or unmasked)
>     - Internal user roles or permissions
>         
> Even though only the order summary is shown on the screen, the backend sends **more data than necessary**, which can be exploited if intercepted or accessed improperly.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Why is it risky?**

- **Hackers** can easily read the raw response and **steal private info**.
- Sensitive data can be used to:
    - Access other systems
    - Pretend to be someone else
    - Attack users or the company


### **âœ… How to prevent this?**

1. Only send **needed data** from the backend â€” not everything.
2. **Never depend on the front-end** to hide private info.
3. Regularly **check API responses** to make sure no sensitive info is leaked.
4. Avoid generic methods like `to_string()` or `to_json()` that return **everything**.
5. Test APIs (automated + manual) to make sure only safe data is returned.
