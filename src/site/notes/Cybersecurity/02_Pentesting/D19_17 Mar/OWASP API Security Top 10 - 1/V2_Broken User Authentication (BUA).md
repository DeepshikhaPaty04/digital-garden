### **What is Broken User Authentication (BUA)?**

It happens when an app or API doesnâ€™t **properly check login credentials** (like email & password).  
This allows attackers to log in as someone else or get access they shouldnâ€™t have.


### **How does it happen?**

- The API only checks **email**, but **ignores the password**.
- Hackers can just guess or find someoneâ€™s email and **log in without a password**.
- This can lead to **data leaks, changes, or full account takeover**.

### Example of Broken User Authentication:

- A user logs in to Instagram using valid credentials.
- After using the app, the user logs out.
- However, the next time the user opens Instagram, they are automatically logged in **without being asked for credentials again**.

> [!NOTE]
> This behavior indicates **broken user authentication**, particularly due to **improper session invalidation**. 
> Logging out should destroy the session token or cookie associated with the user. If the session is not properly invalidated, it allows unauthorized access, violating secure authentication practices.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Why is it dangerous?**

- Hackers 
-can **pretend to be someone else**
- They can **steal sensitive information**
- They can **delete or modify user data**
- They can `take control of someoneâ€™s account`



### **âœ… How to Prevent ?**

1. Always check **both email and password**.
2. Use **strong tokens** (like JWT) for security.
3. Never store passwords in plain text.
4. Add features like:
    - **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
    - **Account lockout after too many tries**
    - **CAPTCHA to stop bots**
5. Never show or send passwords in the URL or request body.
