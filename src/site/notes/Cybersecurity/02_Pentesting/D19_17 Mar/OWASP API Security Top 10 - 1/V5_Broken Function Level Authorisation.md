## **What is Broken Function Level Authorization?**

It's a **security flaw** where a website or app **doesn’t properly check what actions a user is allowed to do**.

So, even if you're **not an admin**, you might still be able to access **admin-only functions** (like deleting users or changing roles) just by guessing or changing the URL.

This usually happens when:
- The system **trusts what's in the request** (like `isAdmin=1`)
- The **user’s role isn't properly checked** in the backend

---

### **Example :**

> [!example]
> Imagine a website with two types of users:
> - 👤 **Normal user**
> - 🛡️ **Admin user**
>     
> Admins can access this URL to delete a user:
> 
> `https://example.com/admin/delete-user?userId=123`
> 
> - But the website **does not check** if you're actually an admin.
> - So if a **normal user copies** that URL and opens it in their browser, the action **still works**!
> 
> 🚨 **This is Broken Function Level Authorization** — the function (delete-user) is not protected by checking the user’s role.

### 🎯 **Why it's dangerous:**

- Hackers or normal users can:
    
    - Access admin functions
    - Modify or delete other users
    - Change roles or settings
        
- It breaks **access control** and **security rules** of the app

### ✅ **How to prevent it:**

1. 🔐 **Always check user roles** on the server before allowing any sensitive action.
2. ❌ **Do not rely only on hidden buttons or menus** to block users.
3. 🧪 **Test** every function to make sure it’s **only available** to the correct roles (admin, manager, etc.).

### 📝 **In Short:**

> [!summary]
> > **Broken Function Level Authorization** means **users can access functions they shouldn't be allowed to**, because the server **doesn't check permissions properly.**
