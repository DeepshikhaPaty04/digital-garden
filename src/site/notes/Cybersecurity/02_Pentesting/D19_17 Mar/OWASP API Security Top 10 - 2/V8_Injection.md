### **What is an Injection Attack?**

**Injection attacks** happen when a hacker sends **malicious data** (like code or commands) into an app, and the app **blindly trusts and runs it**.

This usually happens when user input is **not checked or cleaned** properly.

- `SQL injection`
- `command line injection`

### **Example : Injection (SQL Injection): Login Bypass**

> [!example]
> A college website allows students to log in with their student ID and password.
> The login form does not sanitize inputs. An attacker enters:  
> `' OR '1'='1`  
> into the username and bypasses authentication.
> 
> This is an example of **Injection** because the attacker injects malicious SQL into the login field to manipulate the query and gain unauthorized access.

### **ðŸŽ¯What is it risky?**

- Hackers steal or delete your data
- `Take over accounts`
- Crash your system
- Even run their own code on your server (very dangerous!)


### **âœ… How to Prevent ?**

- **Always check and clean** user input
- **Use frameworks** like Laravel, which have built-in protections
- Use **parameterized queries** (not raw SQL)
- Add rules to your **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
