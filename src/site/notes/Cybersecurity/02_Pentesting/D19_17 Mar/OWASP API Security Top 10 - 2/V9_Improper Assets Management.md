### **What is Inappropriate Asset Management? 

- Inappropriate Asset Management happens when an old version of an API (say APIv1) is left running, even though the new version (APIv2) is the one in use. 
- The problem is that **old versions** donâ€™t have the latest security features and are usually outdated, making them vulnerable. 
- If these old versions aren't properly removed or disabled, hackers can exploit them and get access to sensitive data or even take over the system.


### How Does This Happen?

- Your company builds and uses **APIv2** for everything, but forgets about **APIv1**.
- **APIv1** is still live on the server and may have **security gaps**, like leaking extra user data (balance, address).
- Hackers may target the old version, which isnâ€™t as secure as the newer one.

### **Example : Improper Asset Management: Public Git Repository**

> [!example]
> - A software team uploads their project to a public GitHub repository.
> - The repo contains a `.env` file with **database passwords and secret API keys**.
> - An attacker finds the repo, clones it, and uses the credentials to access the database.
> 
> This is an example of **Improper Asset Management** because sensitive assets were exposed in public repositories without proper cleanup or control.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Why is it risky?**

- **Exposes sensitive data** (like API keys, passwords, config files).
- **Forgotten systems** (e.g., old subdomains, test servers) become easy entry points.
- **Unsecured APIs or files** may be publicly accessible.
- **Increases attack surface**, giving hackers more ways to break in.
- **Outdated or unpatched assets** remain vulnerable.
- **Lack of cleanup** after deployments or migrations leaves backdoors open.
- **No inventory = no protection** â€” you canâ€™t secure what you donâ€™t know exists.


### **âœ… How to Prevent?**

- **Delete old API versions** (if theyâ€™re not needed anymore).
- Ensure that only **the latest version** is available for users to access.
- **Deactivate unused APIs** at the network level and ensure they can't be used.
- **Document everything**. Donâ€™t leave any old versions or endpoints undocumented. This is critical for keeping track of whatâ€™s available.
- **Separate environments** for different stages of development (e.g., testing, production) to prevent accidental exposure.
