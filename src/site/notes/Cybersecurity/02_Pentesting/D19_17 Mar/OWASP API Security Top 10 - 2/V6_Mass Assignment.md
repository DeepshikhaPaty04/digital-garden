### **What is it?**

**Mass assignment** happens when your app **automatically accepts and updates** data from the user **without checking** what data is being sent.

It lets attackers **change things theyâ€™re not supposed to**, like making themselves an admin

This becomes dangerous when:
- The user **adds extra fields** (like `isAdmin`, `credit`, etc.)
- Your app **blindly saves it to the database**, even if those fields should never be changed by the user


### **How does it happen?**

Imagine a **signup form** that asks for:
- Name
- Username
- Password

---
### **Example 1 :**

> [!example]
> The database also has a `credit` field (default = 50), which **users shouldnâ€™t change**.
> 
> But a hacker sends this extra data:
> `{   "name": "Eve",   "username": "eve123",   "password": "1234",   "credit": 1000 }`
> 
> If your backend **automatically saves everything sent**, then `credit = 1000` will be stored! ðŸ˜±


### **Example 2 :**

> [!example]
> - An e-commerce app lets users update their profile via an API call, like changing their name or email.
> - The backend automatically binds all fields from the request without filtering allowed fields.
> - An attacker adds `"role": "admin"` in the request body, and the server accepts it â€” making the attacker an admin.
> 
> This is an example of **Mass Assignment** because the backend allows sensitive fields to be updated directly by users, without proper validation or restrictions.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Why is it risky?**

- Users can **increase their credit** or change sensitive info like `isAdmin: true`
- They may **tamper with data**, giving them **more access or benefits**
- Leads to **privilege escalation** and **data integrity issues**

---
### **âœ… How to prevent this?**

1. **Only allow specific fields** to be saved (use "allowlist" or `fillable`)
2. **Avoid saving everything** the user sends without checking
3. Know how your **framework handles data binding**
4. Use security filters for **create/update operations** on models
