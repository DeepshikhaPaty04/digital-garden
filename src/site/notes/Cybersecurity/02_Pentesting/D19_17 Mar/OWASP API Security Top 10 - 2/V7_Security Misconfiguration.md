### **What is it?**

**Security misconfiguration** happens when the app or server is **not set up securely**, like:

- Leaving **default settings or passwords**
- Showing **detailed error messages** with sensitive data
- Allowing **public access** to private files (like logs or API docs)
- Poorly set **`CORS` (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** policies

> [!important]
> **CORS** stands for **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**.
> 
> It’s a **security feature** built into web browsers that controls **which websites (origins) are allowed to access resources (like APIs) on a server**.

---
### **Example 1: Default Admin Login**

> [!example]
> - A web app uses a popular admin panel like **phpMyAdmin** or **WordPress**, and the admin page is available at:
> `https://example.com/admin`
> 
> - If the developer **forgets to change the default username and password**, an attacker can try:
> `Username: admin Password: admin`
> 
> …and it works! 😬
> 
> Now the attacker has **full control** of the system.

---
### Other Common Examples:

> [!example]
> 
> 1. ❗ **Directory listing enabled**
>     - Visiting `https://example.com/uploads/` shows a list of files.
> 
> 2. 🐞 **Debug mode turned on**
>     - Shows internal errors, file paths, and sometimes passwords.
>         
> 3. 🔒 **No HTTPS (SSL)**
>     - Sends sensitive data (like passwords) in **plain text**.
>         
> 4. 🛠️ **Outdated software**
>     - Using an old version of a framework with known vulnerabilities.

### **🎯 Why is it risky?**

- Hackers can learn **how your system works**
- Can guess or brute force **other endpoints**
- Bypass **security mechanisms**
- **Exploit flaws** using the details shown in error messages


### **✅ How to prevent this?**

1. Hide detailed **error messages** – show only generic ones to users
2. Don’t expose **API docs**, **logs**, or **debugging tools** to the public
3. Disable **default passwords** and **admin panels** for normal users
4. Regularly use **security scanners or audits** to find misconfigurations
5. Turn off **debug mode** in production
