# AD Group Policy

- AD Group Policies are critical pieces of instructions in an AD environment that an IT administrator can configure.
- AD Group policies will determine the behaviour and privileges for users and computers.
- Group policies are primarily a security solution for the AD network.
- Administrators can configure these settings and then implement sets of these settings on sites, domains, or OUs containing users and computers.


> [!example]
> - Suppose there are two Organizational Units in the Active Directory, "Sales" and "IT".
> - Now, we want that the "sales" OU should not access a particular resource in the AD but the "IT" OU should access it.
> - This is how we implement Group Policy.


# Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)

- It is a console which helps us in creating different types of settings (policies/configurations).

# Group Policy Object (GPO)

- This is a collection of settings that are created by GPMC
- Example : Security configurations, password policies, Network deployment, desktop configuration etc.

# Types of Group Policy

There are 2 types of group policy:
1. **Local Group Policy** :
   - Affects only work station it is on.
   - Each computer running the windows line of the operating system has exactly one local group policy.
   - It is available only to the particular computer in which it resides and the users who log on to that computer.
   - The local group policy objects reside in the `%systemroot%\System32\Group Policy` folder.

1. **Centralized Group Policy :**
   - Each domain controller has one or more centralized group policies.
   - They are available to all the machines and user in the AD environment.
   - A centralized Group Policy can be applied to all users and computers in a domain, or to a particular OU depending on where the Group Policy is linked.


# Advantages of Group Policy

1. Strong password policy
2. Regular health checks
3. Management of system
4. Centralized administration
5. Help defend against both insider threats and external attacks.
