# **Domain Controller**
- A **Domain Controller** is a **server** that runs **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.
- It **authenticates and authorizes** users and computers in a **Windows domain network**.
- It is the **central authority** for managing security, users, and policies.

## Features of Domain controller

- Verifies user credentials and controls access to network resources.
- Manages all users, groups, computers, and permissions from one place.
- Hosts and manages the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
- Applies system-wide settings and restrictions using Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
- Syncs directory information with other DCs for redundancy and consistency.
- (Optional) Allows fast searching of directory data across multiple domains.
- Enforces password policies, access control, and login rules.
- Multiple DCs can share the load and provide backup in case one fails.
- Keeps logs of logins, resource access, and administrative changes.

> - **Reset passwords**
> - **Assign who can access what** (like files, folders, printers)
> - **Set rules and policies** (e.g., who can install software, when users can log in)
> - **Control access** to network resources like shared drives, applications, or internet access

## Main Functions of a Domain Controller

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|**Authentication**|Verifies user credentials (e.g., username and password).|
|**Authorization**|Grants or denies access to network resources.|
|**Directory Services**|Stores and organizes data like user accounts, groups, computers, etc.|
|**Policy Enforcement**|Applies **Group Policies** to users and machines.|
|**Replication**|Syncs data with other domain controllers to ensure consistency.|

### **Components Handled by a Domain Controller**

- **Users and Groups**
- **Computers and Devices**
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**
- **Security Policies**
- **Login Scripts**

## Types of Domain Controllers

1. **Primary DC**
   - Older concept (pre-Windows 2000). Today all DCs are peers in modern AD.

2. **Read-Only DC**
   - A DC that cannot make changes (used in branch offices or insecure sites).

3. **Global Catalog Server**
   - Stores full data of its domain + partial data of other domains for searches.


## Importance
- It ensures **secure access** to resources.
- Enables **centralized management** of a network.
- Supports **Single Sign-On (SSO)** – users log in once to access everything they’re allowed to.


> [!NOTE]
> *If a Domain Controller Fails:*
> - Users might not be able to log in or access resources.
> - That’s why networks usually have **multiple DCs** for **redundancy and load balancing**.
