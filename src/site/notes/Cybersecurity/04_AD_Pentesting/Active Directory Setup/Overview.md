# **What is Active Directory?**

- **Active Directory** is a **directory service** developed by **Microsoft** for **Windows domain networks**.
- It stores information about **users, computers, and other resources**, and helps **administrators manage** these resources.
  - Think about it as a phone book for Windows
- Authenticates using **Kerberos tickets**.


> **"Non-Windows devices, such as Linux machines, firewalls, etc. can also authenticate to Active Directory via RADIUS or LDAP."**

Even though **Active Directory (AD)** is made by Microsoft mainly for **Windows devices**, other devices that **don’t run Windows** — like:

- **Linux machines**
- **Firewalls**
- **Routers**
- **VPNs**
    
— **can still use AD to check usernames and passwords**, by using **special protocols** like:

#### **Protocols Involved:**

|Protocol|Full Form|What It Does|
|---|---|---|
|**LDAP**|Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|Lets non-Windows systems talk to AD to **read user information** or **authenticate** users.|
|**RADIUS**|Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service|Used by **network devices (like firewalls, VPNs)** to **verify usernames/passwords** using AD.|

## **Functions of Active Directory**

- **Authentication**: Verifies user credentials (username/password).
- **Authorization**: Grants access to resources based on permissions.
- **Centralized Management**: Manages users, groups, and policies from one place.
- **Group Policy**: Applies specific configurations and security settings to users/computers.


## **Why Use Active Directory?**

Active Directory is the most commonly used identity management service in the world.
(95% of Fortune 1000 companies implement the service in their networks)

- Centralized control and security.
- Simplifies user and resource management.
- Scalable for enterprise environments.
- Supports automation and compliance.
-  Can be exploited without ever attacking patchable exploits.
  - Instead, we abuse features, trusts, components, and more.

> **"Can be exploited without ever attacking patchable exploits. Instead, we abuse features, trusts, components, and more."**

Sometimes, hackers **don’t need to find a software bug or vulnerability** (which would normally be patched by updates).

Instead, they can **misuse existing, built-in features** or **legitimate system configurations** that:
- Were designed to **make things easier or more efficient**
- But can be **abused for malicious purposes**

### **Key Terms Explained:**

|Term|What it Means|
|---|---|
|**Patchable Exploits**|Bugs or flaws in software that can be fixed (patched) with updates|
|**Abuse Features**|Using built-in tools (like PowerShell, Group Policies) for attacks|
|**Trusts**|Relationships between systems/domains that allow automatic access|
|**Components**|Legit parts of the system (like Active Directory features)|

### **Example in Context (Active Directory)**

- **Kerberos Delegation** is a **legit AD feature** used to allow services to act on behalf of users.
- An attacker can **abuse it** to impersonate users and access sensitive data — **without any bug**.
    
Another example:

- **Pass-the-Hash**: Instead of cracking your password, an attacker uses your hashed password (already stored in memory) to log in — using **no vulnerability**.


### **Bottom Line:**

> Not all attacks need a “hole” in the system —  
> Sometimes, the **system’s design itself** (if not secured properly) **can be used against you**.

## **Common AD Terms**

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**LDAP**|Protocol used to access and maintain AD data.|
|**Kerberos**|Default protocol for authentication in AD.|
|**GPO (Group Policy Object)**|Rules applied to users/computers in AD.|

# **Example to understand Active Directory**

> [!example]
> ### **Imagine a School**
> 
> Let’s say there’s a school with many:
> - Teachers
> - Students
> - Computers
> - Shared Files (like assignments, timetables)
>     
> ### **School Office = Active Directory**
> 
> The **School Office** keeps a record of:
> - Who the teachers and students are
> - Which classes they belong to
> - Which computers they use
> - Who can access what files (e.g., teachers can see marksheets, students can't)
>     
> 
> This office also:
> - **Checks ID cards** when someone enters (like **login authentication**)
> - **Tells who can go where** (like **authorization**)
> - **Sets rules**, like computer lab rules for all students (like **Group Policies**)


### **Example in AD Terms**

|School Example|Active Directory Equivalent|
|---|---|
|Student/Teacher|**User account**|
|Class group|**Organizational Unit (OU)** or **Group**|
|School Office|**Domain Controller**|
|ID check at entrance|**Authentication**|
|Permission to access lab|**Authorization / Group Policy**|
|Central record system|**Active Directory Database**|


So, just like the **school office controls everything centrally**, **Active Directory** helps companies **manage users and computers in one place**, securely and efficiently.

> [!summary]
> **Active Directory is a core tool for identity and access control.**  
> Attackers target it **not because it’s weak**, but because it’s **so powerful**.  
> That’s why we need it — and also why we must **harden and monitor it continuously**.
